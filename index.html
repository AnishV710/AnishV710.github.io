                These images were created with generative Artificial Intelligence. These wireframe sketches show different user scenarios in the UofSC Marketplace mobile app. The first sketch shows the UofSC Student Login screen, where users sign in with their university email to access the platform. The second sketch pictures a Student Browsing Listings page, featuring item categories, filters, and product listings for quickly navigating. The third sketch represents a Professor Looking for Office Supplies, highlighting a simple search interface and clean layout for browsing available items.
