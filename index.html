                    USC students lack a safe, convenient, and USC-only platform to buy, sell, or exchange used items such as furniture, textbooks, and dorm supplies.

                These images were created with generative Artificial Intelligence. These wireframe sketches show different user scenarios in the UofSC Marketplace mobile app. Sketch 1 is Posting an Item for Sale which shows a student logging in, creating a new post, uploading photos, previewing their listing, and confirming the post. Sketch 2, which is searching and buying an Item, follows a student browsing listings, filtering search results, viewing product details, and messaging a seller to arrange a purchase. Sketch 3, buying an Item from an available listing, portrays a user logging in, browsing items listed for free, viewing details, and contacting the seller to claim the item.
