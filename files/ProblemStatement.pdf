After freshman year, many students at the University of South Carolina have stress and confusion when trying to find housing for the next school year. Many donâ€™t realize that apartment leases for the following August begin as early as October, forcing students to make housing decisions right after settling into their dorms. Adding on to this, information about available apartments is spread across different websites making it time-consuming and confusing to compare options. Students have to jump between different sites to find floor plans, prices, and availability, and some listings require calling for details that should be easily accessible. Students unaware of the need to choose housing early often end up with limited choices. A main website with all apartment information in one place would make the process much more efficient and reduce stress for students planning where to live.
